# Trip Sniper

This project provides the skeleton for the `trip_sniper` service managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## Installation

1. Install Poetry if it is not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```
2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Running

To run the service module:

```bash
poetry run python -m trip_sniper.service
```

This command will execute the main service package. Adjust the entry point as your implementation evolves.
